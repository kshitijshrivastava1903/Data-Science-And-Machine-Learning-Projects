In this repository, I have used 5 different machine learning algorithms, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES (on the famous Iris dataset
to predict species of flowers on the basis of their features), LINEAR REGRESSION (on the famous Boston housing dataset to
predict prices of houses in Boston on the basis of features regarding locality supplied), RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM (on customer 
data to predict whether they will repay the loan), K-MEANS CLUSTERING (for predicting whether a college is private or public 
on the basis of features supplied), K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS (for classification on the basis of some random data).
